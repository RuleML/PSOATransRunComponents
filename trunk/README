OVERVIEW
PSOATransRun is an implementation of the PSOA RuleML language. PSOATransRun 
composes a translator from PSOA to some target langauge t, and some runtime 
environment executing the language t. This release contains an instantiation 
using t=Prolog, composing a translator PSOA2Prolog and a runtime environment 
XSB Prolog. See http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php?title=PSOA_RuleML for more 
details of PSOA RuleML and PSOATransRun.


REQUIREMENTS
Operating System: Windows
Prerequisites: Java version 6.0 or higher, XSB Prolog 3.5


USAGE
Download PSOATransRun.jar to a directory, which we will call $PSOATransRun_DIR.
Then follow the next steps to run the program:

1. Open the Command Line Prompt
1) Click the key combination Windows+R, a "Run" box will be shown;
2) Type cmd and click "Enter"

2. Change the working directory to $PSOATransRun_DIR by executing
   cd $PSOATransRun_DIR
   If $PSOATransRun_DIR is not on the same drive as the current
   working directory, the command line option /d should be used:
   cd /d $PSOATransRun_DIR
   
3. Execute the following command
   java -jar PSOATransRun.jar -i <kb>

<kb> is the path of the input knowledge base (KB) written in the PSOA RuleML 
presentation syntax.

4. After the message "KB loaded" is shown, you can ask queries. Each time 
when you see the "Input Query" message is prompted, you can input a one-line 
query and click "Enter", and the answers will be shown. To finish, type
Ctrl+Z and click "Enter".

To see all available command line options, execute
   java -jar PSOATransRun.jar -?

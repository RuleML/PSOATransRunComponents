PSOATransRunComponents is structured into @@@

Import Project into Eclipse using Eclipse's Built-in Git Plugin and Prepare for Building
1. Install JDK 8 or higher and Eclipse 4.2 or higher; configure Eclipse so it uses JDK (see http://techiedan.com/2009/10/19/set-up-jdk-in-eclipse/)
2. If you want to submit your changes to this project as a non-collaborator, you need to fork this project under your own GitHub account
3. Import project into Eclipse
   1. Open Eclipse, choose File -> Import -> Git -> Projects from Git and click "Next"
   2. Choose "Clone URI" and click "Next"
   3. Input the URL of your forked repository (if changes need to be submitted) or this GitHub repository (if no changes need to be  submitted)
   4. Input your GitHub credentials and click "Next"
   5. Unselect all branches except the "master" branch and click "Next"
   6. Set your local path of the project folder and click "Next"
   7. Click "Next" and then "Finish" to import the project into Eclipse (pop-up about missing "natures" can be ignored, if no edits on PSOATransRunWebService, currently for TPTP, will be done)
4. Preparation for building project
   1. Go to Eclipse's "Project" menu item and uncheck "Build Automatically"
   2. Expand the dropdown list besides the green run button in the Eclipse toolbar and click "Run Configurations..."
   3. Expand the "Maven Build" menu, choose any one of the "InterPrologInstall" items, and click "Run". This will install the InterProlog library to your local Maven repository.
   4. There should be red-cross error icons shown for projects PSOA2X and PSOACore. If not, try building the project once as explained in the Section "Building Project in Eclipse" (DO NOT perform "Maven -> Update Project" after this build). To fix these errors, follow the next steps.
   5. Expand the "PSOACore" project, open pom.xml and navigate to the "pom.xml" tab.
   6. Hover your cursor over the \<execution\> element with a red wavy underline and click the "Discover new m2e connectors" fix option.
   7. Click "Finish" and follow the guideline to install m2e connectors for ANTLR. The installation will show a security warning "You are installing software that contains unsigned content". Click "OK" to ignore the warning.
   8. Restart Eclipse to finish the preparation process

Building Project in Eclipse
* Right-click the PSOATransRunComponents project in the left panel, choose "Run As -> Maven install" to build the project. This does an incremental build of PSOATransRunComponents and all of its subprojects. The path of the output PSOATransRun jar file is as follows, where \<local repo dir\> typically ends in the segment \PSOATransRunComponents:

  \<local repo dir\>\PSOATransRun\target\PSOATransRunLocal.jar
  
  In case Eclipse still shows errors for the projects (as tiny red crosses in the project icons) after a successful building process, right-click the PSOATransRunComponents project and choose "Maven -> Update Project".
* For a clean (not just incremental) build, which is recommended for the last round of testing and release, click "Run As -> Maven clean" before doing the above "Maven install".

Running Tests
* To test PSOATransRun with provided test directory, execute the following command line from \<local repo dir\>\PSOATransRun

  java -jar target\PSOATransRunLocal.jar --test -i test
  
* To test PSOATransRun with your own test directory, execute the following command line from \<local repo dir\>\PSOATransRun, where \<testDir\> is the path to the test directory:

  java -jar target\PSOATransRunLocal.jar --test -i \<testDir\>
